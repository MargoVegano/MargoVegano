### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Margo.
I've always enjoyed working with data and have always been fascinated by what can be done with it. I worked a lot with data and programming at the university while studying for radiophysics. And in May 2022, I decided to associate myself with Data Science! I have completed many courses in this field, studied Python, SQL and all the libraries/tools necessary for data analysis, machine learning and neural networks. And I keep learning, because it is always need to improve!
